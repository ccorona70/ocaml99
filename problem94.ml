(*# P94 (***) Generate K-regular simple graphs with N nodes
# 
# In a K-regular graph all nodes have a degree of K; i.e. the number of edges
# incident in each node is K. How many (non-isomorphic!) 3-regular graphs with 6
# nodes are there? See also a table of results and a Java applet that can
# represent graphs geometrically.*)
