(*# P84 (**) Construct the minimal spanning tree
# 
# Write a predicate ms-tree(Graph,Tree,Sum) to construct the minimal spanning
# tree of a given labelled graph. Hint: Use the algorithm of Prim. A small
# modification of the solution of P83 does the trick. The data of the example
# graph to the right can be found in the file p84.dat.*)
