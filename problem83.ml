(*# P83 (**) Construct all spanning trees
# 
# Write a predicate s-tree(Graph,Tree) to construct (by backtracking) all
# spanning trees of a given graph. With this predicate, find out how many
# spanning trees there are for the graph depicted to the left. The data of this
# example graph can be found in the file p83.dat. When you have a correct
# solution for the s-tree/2 predicate, use it to define two other useful
# predicates: is-tree(Graph) and is-connected(Graph). Both are five-minutes
# tasks!*)
